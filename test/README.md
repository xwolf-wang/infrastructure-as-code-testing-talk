# Automated tests

This folder contains the automated tests for all of the example code in the [/examples folder](/examples).

**Note**: This repo is for demonstration and learning purposes only and should NOT be used to run anything important. 
For production-ready versions of this code and many other types of infrastructure, check out 
[Gruntwork](https://gruntwork.io/).

## Running automated tests for the Terraform examples

**WARNING**: The Terraform modules and their automated tests deploy real resources into your AWS account which can cost 
you money. The resources are all part of the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), so if you haven't used that 
up, it should be free, but you are completely responsible for all AWS charges.

1. Sign up for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
1. Configure your AWS credentials using one of the [supported methods for AWS CLI
   tools](https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799), 
   such as setting the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables. 
1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and make sure it's on your `PATH`.
1. Install [Golang](https://golang.org/), minimum version `1.13`.
1. `cd test`
1. To run a single test: `go test -v -timeout 15m -run <TEST_NAME>`

## Running automated tests for the Docker and Kubernetes examples

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
1. Install [Golang](https://golang.org/), minimum version `1.13`.
1. China link https://studygolang.com/dl
wget https://studygolang.com/dl/golang/go1.13.7.darwin-amd64.pkg
1. You'll need access to a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster to run these tests. **Recommended option**: 
   If you're using the [Docker Desktop app](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), then you already have a local 
   [Kubernetes cluster installed](https://www.docker.com/blog/kubernetes-is-now-available-in-docker-desktop-stable-channel/)!
   Alternatively, you can run Kubernetes locally using 
   [MiniKube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/) or run these tests against a Kubernetes
   cluster in the cloud, such as [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), 
   [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/), or 
   [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/). 
1. Whichever option you choose to run your Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to 
   [authentiate to it](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/). If you're running 
   Kubernetes locally (e.g., via Docker for Desktop), you're probably already authenticated to it, so there's nothing
   to do.
1. `cd test`
1. To run a single test: `go test -v -timeout 15m -run <TEST_NAME>`
